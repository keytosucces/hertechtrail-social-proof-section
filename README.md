# hertechtrail-social-proof-section
Your challenge is to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Download the zipped file attached, extract it and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc. There is a design folder that provides the view of the page. (Use media queries to make your page responsive).
If you're not clear on anything, feel free to reach out to me.

You're to submit the link to the hosted page and your github repository.
